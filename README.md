# Video Game Dataset Analysis

I applied supervised learning and clustering techniques to analyze video game sales, critic scores, and user scores, uncovering patterns in game performance. 

By examining relationships between critic scores and predictors such as vg score, user score, publisher, developer, and regional sales, I identified key factors influencing game reception. 

To enhance predictive accuracy, I implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA), reducing dimensionality while retaining 85% variance and evaluating its impact through mean squared error. 

Building on this, I developed linear regression models to determine which variables had the strongest effect on North American sales. 

Recognizing the importance of segmentation, I leveraged clustering algorithms—including K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture, and Hierarchical Clustering—to categorize games based on critic scores, user scores, and sales data. 

To further refine these models, I optimized performance through hyperparameter tuning, using the elbow method and silhouette score to validate clustering effectiveness. 

Throughout the analysis, I created data visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and scree plots to clearly communicate insights. 

Ensuring data integrity was also a priority, so I handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized continuous features to maintain consistency. 

Ultimately, this comprehensive approach allowed me to extract meaningful insights into publisher influence, market segmentation, and critical reception trends, providing a deeper understanding of the video game industry.
